# Automouse: A Python-based software to make automatic mouse-clickings 
This is a set of programs that automatically move and click the mouse. The program is based on Python's tkinter and pyautogui packages. The program consists of two parts, the first is to get and record the coordinates of a specific screen position, and the second is to fill in the coordinates for cyclic clicking.
